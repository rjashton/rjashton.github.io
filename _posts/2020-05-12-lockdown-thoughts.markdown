# Lockdown thoughts

The standard two year period has passed between blog posts. I think I got quite busy after writing the [last post](https://robinashton.com/blog/2018/04/16/meta-posts-best-posts.html). Funny how that works, things that aren't a priority (blogging) fall by the wayside. 

Here are some sentences that I think you'd have said were part of an alt-fiction novel the last time I wrote:

- We find ourselves sequestered at home because of an outbreak of a global pandemic. 
- Boris Johnson is Prime Minister. 
- The UK is zombie-walking into a no deal Brexit because we have a dysfunctional government too busy to deal with the EU and too ideological to further extend the negotiation period.

Okay, okay. Maybe the last sentence could have been predicted. 

üßü‚Äçüßü‚Äçüßü‚Äç

Lockdown is more locked down for some than others. I've still been out and about from time to time for work, performing installations on site for the most part. Wendy has been working from home for the whole period (and a little before) though. 

It has been difficult for us not being able to go out at the weekends. It's much easier for me to be content at home with a game or a book or a film, and staying at home is welcome. For Wendy less so, and it has been a source of friction for us at times.

And that's just one household. We don't have a garden to sit in and enjoy while the whether was warm. We can't barbecue in the park. At least we are both working and haven't been furloughed. At least we have employment that can be done from a remote location and doesn't require us to attend in person.

Having mentioned that I've been out... I've not been out very much and I am missing driving about listening to podcasts. I'm so far behind on them now and basically only have time to listen to [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com) ([+ aftershow](http://giveusyourfuckingmoney.com)) and [The Adventure Zone](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/) during snatched moments doing the washing up and very occasionally during the working day when I'm doing something that can't really involve much reading.

One of my most enjoyable treats pre-lockdown was on a Friday morning going through a McDonald's Drive Thru to get a breakfast meal and then consuming this delicious treat while listening to said podcasts. I miss this.

I think those are enough thoughts for now. Need to keep some in the tank for next year's post.

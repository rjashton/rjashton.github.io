Just looking back through some old posts and in January 2014 I wrote a [post with some vague goals](https://robinashton.com/blog/2014/01/10/disorganised-thoughts-on-resolutions.html). I've done alright in the past three years...

- Write more words down ❌
- Stop gaining more weight 👍🏻
- Be stronger (as in Popeye) ❌
- Learn to drive a car 👍🏻
- Get a pay rise 👍🏻
- Stop paying for someone else's mortgage 👍🏻

Not bad.

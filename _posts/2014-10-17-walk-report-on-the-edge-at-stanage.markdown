I went for a walk yesterday, walk 21 out of the AA 50 Walks in the Peak District book. The walk was a loop starting in Hathersage, taking me up along Stanage edge and then up Higger Tor before completing the loop.

Got off the train at about 9.50 and realised I didn't have my map with me so wandered into Hathersage to get a new one. I was going to buy the weatherproofed version of OL1 but ended up getting a BMC map that covered slightly further south after mentioning why I was buying a new map to the clerk in the shop. Seems like a nice map - prettier than the OS maybe - but it might take a while to internalise the key to the same level as I have with OS maps.

Started walking at about 10.10 leaving town and heading through some fields and past a few old manors and cottages. The road really kicked up towards North Lees and I found myself stripping off jumper and jacket to walk in just my t-shirt. The cloud was pretty thick at this point but I had a hard time seeing anything out of my steamed-up glasses anyway. Through one more field and then out onto the fell proper walking up through some bracken and through a tree plantation.

After passing through the trees I stopped for the first time and had a drink and something to eat, about 11am, suddenly faced with Stanage Edge. The clouds were starting to clear now with patches of blue in the sky. They cleared quickly and as I walked up and through a gap in the cliffs up onto the ledge you could see out over Bamford Moor below the cliff and over the Hallam Moors at the top. Walked along the path up to the trig point at High Neb and had some lunch - about 12 o'clock. Called Amanda to let her know I'd not died alone and cold on the moors.

From here I turned around and walked back along the edge, a nice breeze and some sunshine. Suddenly there were plenty of others walking along the edge as well. Walking along the edge was hard work. While the gradient was shallow the path wasn't much of a path - lots of rocks and pools of water along the top. In parts there was a sandy path as well and it felt like I was walking along the seaside - especially when I caught a whiff of salt from my sweat. I was starting to feel quite tired at this point and was regretting bringing a jumper and my camera - I'd rather have had the space and weight taken up with extra bottles of water.

Eventually made it up to the trig point at the other end of the cliff after passing some children in Robin Hood's 'Cave' and some paragliders. From there down to the car park at Burbage bridge and another rest - finished my water and had a caramel wafer - before heading up the path to Higger Tor. Again the path had a rough surface and was hard going - I was really quite tired at this point - only 2/3rds through the walk! I was passed by two fell runners along this path which really rubbed it in, all I could think was 'I used to do that'.

At the end of the path there was a sharp kick up to the top of Higger Tor. Once I reached the top I walked around a little on the plateau but eventually sat and rested a while again. In the valley below there was some forestry work going on - there had been a notice further back about some paths being closed temporarily. There was a helicopter transporting tree stumps from below me over to the other side of the stream.

Eventually picked myself up again and started on the last part of the walk - mostly down hill from here back into Hathersage. I was glad that the walk had this part at the end rather than at the start. It felt steeper going down than it had been going up and it felt as thought there was a lack of things to look at and take your mind off the gradient. This could just be because I was too tired to notice things that take your mind off the gradient at this point though! I followed the path down past and through the church graveyard where Little John is supposedly buried in a long grave (it's probably about 7 feet long). From there just a short walk back into the village centre.

All together that was 9 miles + a bit extra for where the map key confused me and I took the wrong path... I really enjoyed the first part of the walk but then started to get quite tired and I think that I had a harder time enjoying things after that.

I should have known better that I was going to get hot and need less clothes - I carried my jumper around in my bag all day and found that I had to have my fleece off most of the time. It was warmer than I expected but even so I don't think I had enough water with me and probably didn't take enough liquid onboard before leaving in the morning.

I didn't take any pictures - it was too cloudy early on when I was able to but by the time the visibility improved I was too tired to want to do that. My camera might be staying at home until I know what I'm going to take a picture of in advance or until I have a bigger bag and am a bit fitter.

I finished the walk faster than the 'minimum' 5 hours. Not sure what that means - I don't think that I was walking particularly fast. If anything, at the end, I felt like I was trudging along dragging my feet.  Perhaps I should have stopped more often or for longer.

I'd like to hear suggestions on how to stop your glasses steaming up.

I've been avoiding writing about this for a while now, at least publicly. I don't like the idea of being melodramatic or whinging, there are people worse off than I.

However, I'm pretty scared about my health and wellbeing. I was recently diagnosed with testicular cancer. I've since had an orchidectomy and various scans that indicate no remaining cancerous growths. I'm still (probably) going to have a single course of chemotherapy.

This would be pretty crap by itself but whilst in for one of said scans I blacked out and worried everyone quite a bit. I was referred to a cardiologist and have now found an abnormality in the way my heart pumps blood during an ultrasound scan.

The chemotherapy has now been postponed and I will be subject to more testing on my heart. I have an exercise test scheduled, MRI scan of my heart to be organised as well as a longterm ECG monitor surgically planted below my left collarbone.

There are still a number of things unknown about any conditions I might have. I've not spoken to the consultant for my cancer treatment about the reasons for postponing yet either. This is another reason why I'm reluctant to talk about the way I feel about things because it will likely change on Friday when I go the Christie and speak with him.

But I have a stinky cold and I'm stressed out and I'm tired.

I'm worried and slightly angry that I may not now be able to have chemotherapy. Worried because it significantly reduces the risks of the cancer returning; angry because I've been stressed and worried about the side effects of the chemo, both short-term and long-term. I've been building myself up to it.

I'm worried about my wife and fell guilty about the emotional toll it places on her.

I'm worried about work and that the huge amount of goodwill and patience shown to me so far will run out at some point.

I'm worried about the implications for my future life and how it restricts choices.

I'm worried I won't be able to have children.

I'm worried that I might die.

Most of these only worry me when I'm already upset, a self-reinforcing self-pity cycle. Most of these are also quite rational fears. Most are things that I have significant control over too. But that doesn't stop them being scary.

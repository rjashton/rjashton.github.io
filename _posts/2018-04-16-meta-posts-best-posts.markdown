Seems that the only posts I write now are posts about my blog. In fairness those are the only changes that I've been making here...

Either way, I felt some of the old posts I had on my blog were important (enough) to port across.

- [Illness and Unknowns](https://robinashton.com/blog/2013/04/23/illness-and-unknowns.html)
- [Disorganised thoughts on resolutions and some ambitions I won't feel too bad about not achieving](https://robinashton.com/blog/2014/01/10/disorganised-thoughts-on-resolutions.html)
- [Walk Report: On the Edge at Stanage](https://robinashton.com/blog/2014/10/17/walk-report-on-the-edge-at-stanage.html)
- [Four out of Six, Not Bad](https://robinashton.com/blog/2017/09/21/four-out-of-six-not-bad.html)

Those are the four that seem to actually about me and things that I've done, rather than about opinions I have or just links to things I thought were good. I may still bring across more of my 'opinion' posts but I think the 'something cool on the internet' posts will die along with my Squarespace website.

I'm changing where my site is hosted, to save money and to learn something new at the same time. I'm moving from Squarespace (super easy) to a static site generated with [Jekyll][https://jekyllrb.com] hosted on GitHub pages (hopefully manageable learning curve).

I'll probably move some posts across but not all of them, just the more 'important' ones.

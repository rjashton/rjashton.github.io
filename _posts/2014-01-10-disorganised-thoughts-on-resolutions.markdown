Feels like it is late to post anything to do with resolutions, they seem to be an idea that everyone forgets about by the 6th of January. 

The word resolve seems a bit strong for me, I'm a pretty non-commital kinda chap. Takes work to drop out of uni three times dontcha know.

Here are a few things that would be nice to achieve:

- Write more words down
- Stop gaining more weight 
- Be stronger (as in Popeye)
- Learn to drive a car
- Get a pay rise
- Stop paying for someone else's mortgage.

That seems like enough to be getting on with.
